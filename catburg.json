                "As a cat burglar, you’ve honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas, drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue’s life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.",
                "So successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques.",
                "Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.",
                "Some cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums.",
                "You’ll likely end up someplace you’re not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!"
